# Programming Languages and Data Structures - C++ Code Repository

Welcome to my repo, which contains all the C++ codes from my M.Sc. first-year course titled **Programming Languages and Data Structures**. This repository is organized into two main folders: **PDFs** and **Codes**.

## Folder Structure

### 1. **PDFs Folder**
- This folder contains the most recent and correct versions of my C++ codes.
- The PDFs are well-organized and should provide a clear reference for each programming assignment or project from the course.

### 2. **Codes Folder**
- This folder holds all versions of my C++ codes, including earlier drafts and revisions.
- Each file may have multiple versions, so it's important to verify the correctness of the code by running it yourself.

## How to Use the Repository

### 1. **Review PDFs:**
   - Start by reviewing the **PDFs folder**. These documents contain the finalized and correct versions of the codes, as far as I know.

### 2. **Verify Code Versions:**
   - If you want to work directly with the C++ files, browse the **Codes folder**.
   - For files with similar names but different version numbers (e.g., `HeapTreePrint.cpp`, `HeapTreePrint2.cpp`, `HeapTreePrint3.cpp`), the last numbered file is likely the most correct version. However, I still recommend running the code to verify this.
   - Compare the output of these files with the corresponding code in the PDFs to ensure accuracy.

### 3. **Running the Codes:**
   - Make sure to compile and run the codes in your development environment.
   - Cross-check the output with the expected results to confirm correctness.

## Contact Information
